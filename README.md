### **Flowchart Explanation**  
- The **user performs an ASL sign**, which is captured by the **camera**.  
- The **preprocessing step** removes noise, normalizes frames, and extracts hand features.  
- The **deep learning model (CNN + LSTM)** recognizes the **gesture and classifies it**.  
- If the **gesture matches the ASL vocabulary**, it's **converted to text output** and optionally **spoken using TTS**.  
- If the **gesture is unclear**, the system **prompts the user to repeat it**.  

This flowchart **accurately represents the ASL recognition process** while ensuring **real-time, efficient, and accurate translation**. ðŸš€
